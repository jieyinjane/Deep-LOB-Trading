**Introduction**

This repository contains the datasets and codes described in the paper "...". We propose a system model contains training, predicting and trading and evaluate it on the simulation data and the empirical data.

**Data**

We simulate three datasets with different financial environments and one dataset under a long-term and mixed period. All of them are in the 

**Code**

The codes written by Python are provided in the [fold](Code) for the simulation dataset under a long-term and mixed period.

- DCNN.py: Labelling, training and predicting.

- invest_strat_op.py: Trading strategy with optimization and without optimization.
